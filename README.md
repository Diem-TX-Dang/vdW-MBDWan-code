Usage Notes:
To compute the van der Waals and/or induction energies in materials, the following steps must be executed:

- Obtain the electronic structure of a given system using the Quantum ESPRESSO code, without a van der Waals correction.

- Obtain the MLWFs for the system by interpolating the DFT application using wannier90.x

- Determine the optical polarizability of the system in imaginary frequency by copying the executive postw90_vdW-WanMBD.x to the current folder and excuting: ./postw90_vdW-WanMBD.x seedname. This will generate the following output files:'seedname'-polarizability_xx.dat, 'seedname'-polarizability_xy.dat, ..., 'seedname'-polarizability_zz.dat.    

- Create a folder to execute vdW-WanMBD code and copy the following files to this folder

  	all 9 optical polarizability files 'seedname-polarizability_xx.dat', ..., 'seedname-polarizability_zz.dat'
  
	'scf.out' and 'nscf.out' files from the DFT self-consistent calculations for the bulk layered system
  
	'seedname.wout', 'seedname_r.dat' files for the bulk layered system calculated by Wannier90
  
	'CHARGE.lobster' file from partial charge population analysis by LOBSTER code for the bulk layered system  (this file is needed if the investigating system is polarized i.e. pol = 1)

  	'scf.out' file from the DFT self-consistent calculation for the monolayer component into subfolder /mono (this file is needed if calculating binding energy i.e. mono = 1)
  
	'vdW-WanMBD.py' file from 'bin' folder
		
- In this folder, provide the following information into the input file 'input.in':

  	name of the investigating system: seedname = ...                      Example: seedname = MoS2
  
	numbers of Wannier functions for each type of atoms: N_WF_at = ...    Example: N_WF_at = 5 4 for the case of MoS2 (5 Wannier functions for Mo and 4 Wannier Functions for S)

	gamma, the parameter in damping function (Eq. 10): gM = ...           Example: gM = 1 or gM = 1.31 in this study

	for polar systems, such as hBN, MoS2: pol = 1. For non-polar systems, such as graphite: pol = 0.

  	if calculating the binding energy: mono = 1. Otherwise: mono = 0
	
- Execute: python vdW-WanMBD.py > output.out

- The generated output file 'output.out' includes the following information:
  
  the name of investigated system

  lattice constant along c axis in Å unit
  
  interlayer distance in Å unit
      
  unit cell volume in Å^3 unit
  
  vdW energy in eV unit

  induction energy in eV unit (if 'pol = 0', induction energy is zero)

  binding energy in meV/atom unit (if 'mono = 0', this information is not publised)

Examples:

Dispersion and binding energies are included for three representative materials.
